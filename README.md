My name is [Dylan](https://dylanbretzjr.com/) :)

I'm a musician, problem solver, and lifelong learner transitioning to data analytics.

I bring a unique blend of analytical, creative, and critical thinking to everything I do.

I'm currently building my portfolio, obtaining certifications, and refining my technical skills.

I use Python, SQL, R, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Markdown, as well as spreadsheets and Tableau.

I'm currently seeking entry-level Data Analyst roles (remote preferred).

I'm based in Ohio but open to relocating (esp. to PNW 🌲).

**Recently completed:**
- Google Data Analysis with Python Specialization
- Google Data Analytics Specialization

Outside of work, I enjoy watching movies, listening to music, reading, spending time outdoors, and healthy living.

Thanks for stopping by — more coming soon!
